      <h1>i-html</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/keithamus/i-html">i-html</a> is a drop in
        tag that allows for dynamically <em>importing</em> html,
        <em>inline</em>. It's a bit like an <code>&lt;iframe></code>, except the
        html gets adopted into the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have used something similar before, it might seem familiar to
        other techniques such as
        <a href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">hotwired turbo</a> or similar. You
        might have even used an element very close to this one, for example the
        popular
        <a href="https://github.com/github/include-fragment-element"
          >include-fragment-element</a
        >
        by GitHub. This element is a spiritual successor to that one (more on
        that below). But this one is <code>&lt;i-html></code>. Let's talk about
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the box below is a demonstration of the element. The box is there
        to help you see it, but the element is inside. If JavaScript is enabled
        the contents of the box should read "Hello world!". The source page is
        just an HTML page. There's nothing special about it. Look, go see for
        yourself: <a href="example-responses/hello.html">hello.html</a>.
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;i-html <mark>src="example-responses/hello.html"</mark>>Loading...&lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <i-html src="example-responses/hello.html">Loading...</i-html>
      </div>

      <p>
        The <code>&lt;i-html></code> tag can be placed on a page, as an empty
        container. It is completely unstyled (well almost, it has
        <code>display:contents</code>). Whenever the <code>src=</code> attribute
        changes, it will fetch the requested resource as
        <code>text/html</code> and replace its inner contents with the parsed
        contents of the response. That's essentially all it does. Kind of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Setting <code>src=</code> and leaving it alone does not really
        demonstrate the full utility, however, because it is far more capable of
        interesting things when utilised correctly. People do lots of novel
        things with <code>&lt;img></code> tags, and <code>&lt;i-html></code>
        should be no different.
      </p>

      <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

      <p>
        The easiest way to start is to include the minified script from the CDN:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/i-html-element/i-html.min.js" defer>&lt;/script>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        or run <code>npm i i-html-element</code> and use the local module:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;script type="module" src="node_modules/i-html-element/i-html.js">&lt;/script>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2 id="features">Features</h2>

      <h3 id="link-target">Targeting with link</h3>

      <p>
        Like an iframe, <code>&lt;i-html></code> respects the
        <code>target=</code> attribute on links. If an
        <code>&lt;a target=></code> points to the <code>&lt;i-html></code>, then
        the <code>src=</code> is switched with that of the link. A
        demonstration:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;a href="example-responses/hello.html" <mark>target="link-target-example"</mark>>
    Load hello.html
  &lt;/a>
  &lt;a href="example-responses/how-are-you.html" <mark>target="link-target-example"</mark>>
    Load how-are-you.html
  &lt;/a>&lt;br>
  &lt;i-html <mark>id="link-target-example"</mark>>&lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <a href="example-responses/hello.html" target="link-target-example">
          Load hello.html
        </a>
        <a href="example-responses/how-are-you.html" target="link-target-example">
          Load how-are-you.html
        </a><br>
        <i-html id="link-target-example"></i-html>
      </div>

      <h3 id="form-target">Targeting with form</h3>

      <p>
        Also like an iframe, <code>target=</code> on forms is also respected.
        This means forms can submit to an <code>&lt;i-html></code> element which
        will then load in new content. Here's a dummy form, for example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;form action="example-responses/form-save.html" method="get" <mark>target="form-target-example"</mark>>
    &lt;label>
      A form label:
      &lt;input type="search" />
    &lt;/label>
    &lt;button type="submit">Submit&lt;/button>
  &lt;/form>

  &lt;p>Submitting the form will change the content below:&lt;/p>

  &lt;i-html <mark>id="form-target-example"</mark>>Nothing yet&lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <form action="example-responses/form-save.html" method="get" target="form-target-example">
          <label>
             A form label:
            <input type="search" />
          </label>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>

        <p>Submitting the form will change the content below:</p>

        <i-html id="form-target-example">Nothing yet</i-html>
      </div>

      <h3 id="form-wrap">Wrapping a form</h3>

      <p>
        Wrap a <code>&lt;form></code> tag in an <code>&lt;i-html></code> element
        and you'll have a form that replaces itself. Serve the same form back
        and you have an "AJAX style" form with no effort.
      </p>
      
      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;i-html <mark>id="ajax-form-target-example"</mark>>
    &lt;form action="example-responses/ajax-form.html" method="get" <mark>target="ajax-form-target-example"</mark>>
      &lt;label>
        A form label:
        &lt;input type="search" />
      &lt;/label>
      &lt;button type="submit">Submit&lt;/button>
    &lt;/form>

    &lt;p>Submitting the form will change the whole form&lt;/p>
  &lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <i-html id="ajax-form-target-example">
          <form action="example-responses/ajax-form.html" method="get" target="ajax-form-target-example">
            <label>
              A form label:
              <input type="search" />
            </label>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>

          <p>Submitting the form will change the whole form</p>
        </i-html>
      </div>

      <h3 id="form-actions">Form actions</h3>

      <p>
        Of course because <code>&lt;forms></code> work, so does
        <code>&lt;button formaction=</code>. Example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;form method="get" <mark>target="formaction-example"</mark>>
    &lt;button <mark a>formaction="example-responses/form-delete.html"</mark> type="submit">
      Delete
    &lt;/button>
    &lt;button <mark a>formaction="example-responses/form-save.html"</mark> type="submit">
      Save
    &lt;/button>
  &lt;/form>

  &lt;p>Submitting the form will change the content below:&lt;/p>

  &lt;i-html <mark>id="formaction-example"</mark>>Nothing yet&lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <form method="get" target="formaction-example">
          <button formaction="example-responses/form-delete.html" type="submit">
            Delete
          </button>
          <button formaction="example-responses/form-save.html" type="submit">
            Save
          </button>
        </form>

        <p>Submitting the form will change the content below:</p>

        <i-html id="formaction-example">Nothing yet</i-html>
      </div>

      <h3 id="targeting-response">Targeting the response</h3>

      <p>
        By default <code>&lt;i-html></code> will parse the response as HTML,
        and inject the <code>&lt;body></code> element's contents into itself,
        ignoring any unwrapped text nodes. The selection of content to be
        injected can be customized by setting the <code>target=</code> attribute
        on <code>&lt;i-html></code> itself (which defaults to <code>'body>*'</code>
        (or <code>'svg'</code> if <code>accept=</code> is an SVG mime)). If you
        find you want to take a different element from the response body, set
        <code>target=</code> to any valid <code>querySelector</code>. If
        <code>target=</code> is an invalid <code>querySelector</code> it'll
        revert to <code>'body>*'</code>. You can check if a
        <code>target=</code> select is valid by using JavaScript to set
        <code>.target</code> and then read the value back out, for example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  myEl.target = '/not a valid selector/' // this won't set:
  console.assert(myEl.target === 'body')

  myEl.accept = '.this[is]:valid' // this will set:
  console.assert(myEl.target === '.this[is]:valid')
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the below example, these two links fetch the same HTML, which has two
        paragraphs. However the two links target two different
        <code>&lt;i-html></code> elements, the first one with a
        <code>target="p:first-child"</code>, the second with a
        <code>target="p:last-child"</code>.
      </p>
      
      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;a href="example-responses/two-paragraphs.html" <mark>target="two-paragraphs-a"</mark>>
    Load two-paragraphs.html into first target
  &lt;/a>
  &lt;a href="example-responses/two-paragraphs.html" <mark>target="two-paragraphs-b"</mark>>
    Load two-paragraphs.html into first target
  &lt;/a>
  &lt;p>&lt;i-html <mark>id="two-paragraphs-a"</mark> <mark a>target="p:first-child"</mark>>&lt;/i-html>&lt;/p>
  &lt;p>&lt;i-html <mark>id="two-paragraphs-b"</mark> <mark a>target="p:last-child"</mark>>&lt;/i-html>&lt;/p>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <a href="example-responses/two-paragraphs.html" target="two-paragraphs-a">
          Load two-paragraphs.html into first target
        </a>
        <a href="example-responses/two-paragraphs.html" target="two-paragraphs-b">
          Load two-paragraphs.html into first target
        </a>
        <p><i-html id="two-paragraphs-a" target="p:first-child"></i-html></p>
        <p><i-html id="two-paragraphs-b" target="p:last-child"></i-html></p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="re-fetching">Refetching</h3>

      <p>
        If you want to refetch the contents there are several options. The
        simplest is to use an <code>&lt;a href></code> element, as clicking the
        link will cause <code>&lt;i-html></code> to load each time.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not always the easiest though, and so another option is to use a
        <code>&lt;button command="--load" commandfor=".."></code> element,
        which will cause the <code>&lt;i-html></code> to load the
        <code>src</code> it has (regardless of the <code>loading=</code> value,
        see <a href="#deferring-loading">Deferring Loading</a> for more on
        that).
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>(For older browsers that don't support command/commandfor buttons)</summary>
        <p>
          You'll need to drop in the "invokers-polyfill" package to polyfill
          this in older browsers.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          &lt;script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/invokers-polyfill@0.4.2/invoker.js">
          &lt;/script>
        </code></pre>
      </details>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;button <mark>command="--load" commandfor="command-load-example"</mark>>Load&lt;/button>
  &lt;i-html <mark>id="command-load-example"</mark> src="example-responses/hello.html">&lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <button command="--load" commandfor="command-load-example">Load</button>
        <i-html id="command-load-example" src="example-responses/hello.html"></i-html>
      </div>

      <p>
        Responses can indicate to the client when the content should refresh by
        adding a `Refresh` header (or a <code>&lt;meta http-equiv=refresh></code>
        meta tag), telling <code>&lt;i-html></code> to refresh after N seconds.
        This is <em>opt-in</em> though, and needs the <code>allow=refresh</code>
        attribute on the element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The `Refresh` header can also have a URL to traverse to. This is also
        respected, which can make for some interesting properties such as the
        example below. Lastly, this can be stopped with
        <code>&lt;button command="--stop"</code>:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;button <mark>command="--stop" commandfor="refresh-example"</mark>>Stop&lt;/button>
  &lt;i-html <mark b>allow="refresh"</mark> <mark>id="refresh-example"</mark> src="example-responses/refresh.html">&lt;/i-html>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <button command="--stop" commandfor="refresh-example">Stop</button>
        <i-html allow="refresh" loading="lazy" id="refresh-example" src="example-responses/refresh.html"></i-html>
      </div>


      <h3 id="content-negotiation">Content negotiation</h3>

      <p>
        By default <code>&lt;i-html></code> will make a request using the header
        <code>Accept: text/html</code>. You can customise this by setting the
        <code>accept=</code> attribute, but it is limited to certain values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>text/plain</code>.</li>
        <li><code>text/html</code>.</li>
        <li><code>image/svg+xml</code>.</li>
        <li><code>application/xml</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can slightly customise these types by setting the "subtype combination"
        or "parameter values", and it'll be smart and make the request with those
        extras. This means <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> will work, and the
        expected return content-type must be either <code>application/xml</code> or
        <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> (but an entirely different sub-type like
        <code>application/atom+xml</code> will fail). Also more complex mime
        types like <code>text/fragment+html; charset=utf-8</code> will work, and
        the server can respond with the generic <code>text/html</code> or the matching
        sub-type of <code>text/fragment+html</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Invalid mimes such as <code>application/json</code> will revert to
        <code>text/html</code>. (If you want to get JSON you don't need this element).
      </p>
      <p>
        You can check what type works by using JavaScript to set <code>.accept</code>
        and then read the value back out, for example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  myEl.accept = 'application/json' // this won't set:
  console.assert(myEl.accept === 'text/html')

  myEl.accept = 'text/fragment+html; charset=utf-8' // this will set:
  console.assert(myEl.accept === 'text/fragment+html; charset=utf-8')
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        The mime types <code>text/html</code>, <code>image/svg+xml</code>, and
        <code>application/xml</code> will all use <code>DOMParser</code> to
        parse the full response body. <code>text/event-stream</code> uses a
        different streaming mode...
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;a href="star-solid.svg" <mark>target="svg-example"</mark>>
    &lt;i-html <mark>id="svg-example"</mark> src="example-responses/star.svg" <mark a>accept="image/svg+xml"</mark>>&lt;/i-html>
  &lt;/a>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <div class="demo">
        <center>
          <a href="example-responses/star-solid.svg" target="svg-example">
            <i-html id="svg-example" src="example-responses/star.svg" accept="image/svg+xml"></i-html>
          </a>
        </center>
      </div>


      <h3 id="streaming-mode">Streaming Mode</h3>

      <p>
        With the <code>accept=</code> attribute set to
        <code>text/event-stream</code>, it will use an
        <code>EventSource</code> to listen for
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events"
          >Server-Side Events</a
        >. A connection will be open and for each event fired, the response will
        be converted using <code>DOMParser</code> and replaced. This allows for
        many replacements with one request (this could be useful, for example,
        to show a notification count for a user). The connection will be kept
        open and replacing contents until either the server drops out, the
        browser closes the <code>EventSource</code>, the element is removed from
        the DOM, or the <code>src=</code> or <code>accept=</code> attributes
        change value.
      </p>

      <h3 id="insertion-mode">Insertion Mode</h3>

      <p>
        Whether in streaming mode or one-shot mode, the default operation is to
        replace the contents of the element with the newly downloaded contents.
        While this is useful <em>most of the time</em>, some of the time it can
        be even more useful to switch to an append mode. Changing to
        <code>insert=append</code> will cause new content to be added after all
        the current children, and using <code>insert=prepend</code> will cause
        new content to be added before the current children:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
  &lt;a href="example-responses/prepend-list.html" <mark>target="prepend-example"</mark>>
    Prepend to this list:

      <h3 id="deferring-loading">Deferring Loading</h3>

      <p>
        Just like <code>&lt;img></code> and <code>&lt;iframe></code> tags,
        <code>&lt;i-html></code> tags have a <code>loading=</code> attribute. By
        default they are <code>loading=eager</code>, but changing it to
        <code>loading=lazy</code> means it will wait until it's visible in the
        viewport until it makes the request. This also respects CSS styles, so
        if it's inside an element with <code>display:none</code> then
        <code>loading=lazy</code> can prevent it from loading until its
        container is <code>display:block</code>. This is really handy for
        components like <code>&lt;dialog></code>s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Changing to <code>loading=none</code> means it will <em>never load</em>,
        unless the <code>loading=</code> attribute is changed back to either
        <code>loading=eager</code> or <code>loading=lazy</code>. This gives you
        an opportunity to use JavaScript to determine when the loading should
        occur, for example on click.
      </p>

      <p>
        A <code>&lt;button command="--load" commandfor=".."></code> element
        pointing to a, <code>&lt;i-html></code> element will force it to load,
        regardless of the <code>loading=</code> value.
      </p>

      <div class="demo">
        <i-html id="lazy-example" loading="lazy" src="example-responses/lazy.html">
          ... lazy loading ...
        </i-html>
      </div>

      <h3 id="security">Security</h3>

      <p>
        Injecting arbitrary HTML into a page can pose some security risks, so
        it's important that there's a <em>defence in depth</em> approach to
        mitigating the risk surface area. <code>&lt;i-html></code> has some
        security provisions in place but it's important to not only lean on
        these, and also apply additional security measures:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">
            Content Security Policy
          </a>. A good minimum default is <code>script-src self</code>, which
          will prevent JavaScript from executing unless it's served by the same
          origin, and only from <code>&lt;script></code> tags, not inline
          attributes such as <code>onclick</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider how to <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html">
            protect against CSRF
          </a>. A good measure would be HTTP-only session cookies to protect
          sensitive resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fine tune your <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">
            CORS policies
          </a> to protect against injecting pages you might not want
          <code>&lt;i-html></code> to embed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With that out of the way, let's talk about the protections
        <code>&lt;i-html></code> has in place. It uses <code>fetch()</code>
        under-the-hood and so must adhere to CORS policies. By default the
        <code>credentials</code> option is set to <code>'same-origin'</code>
        meaning it will send cookies (and respect the <code>Set-Cookie</code>
        response header) for same-orign requests. To lock this down further
        setting <code>credentials="omit"</code> will never send/recieve cookies,
        and setting <code>credentials="include"</code> will open it up to
        sending/receiving cookies in cross-origin requests.
      </p>

      <p>
        The default behaviour of <code>&lt;i-html></code> is restricted in some
        ways, and these restrictions can be lifted by adding keywords into the
        <code>allow=</code> attribute. This attribute takes a space-separated
        list of well-known keywords, and each one will allow a certain type of
        previously restricted behaviour to happen. The keywords can be combined,
        so for example <code>allow="refresh media cross-origin"</code> is a
        valid value.
      </p>

      <h4 id="cross-origin">Cross Origin (<code>allow="cross-origin"</code>)</h4>

      <p>
        The default behaviour of <code>&lt;i-html></code> is to <em>only</em>
        fetch same-origin URLs. This means
        <code>&lt;i-html src="https://other-site"></code> won't actually do
        anything, as you'll need to allow cross-origin requests explicitly.
        This can be done with the <code>allow="cross-origin"</code> attribute.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is important to note that <code>allow="cross-origin"</code> only
        impacts the <em>initial fetch</em>. Without
        <code>allow="cross-origin"</code> a page may still have URLs or
        resources (such as images) to other origins, and these will be rendered
        regardless of this setting.
      </p>

      <h4 id="sanitization">Sanitization</h4>

      <p>
        <code>&lt;i-html></code> will never explicitly append certain elements
        into the page, unless you opt in. For example if a response contains an
        <code>&lt;iframe></code> element, this will simply be deleted before
        the contents are injected. If you want <code>&lt;iframe></code>
        elements to be injected, you'll need to add the
        <code>allow="iframe"</code> attribute to the element.
        <code>&lt;iframe></code>s aren't the only elements that get sanitized.
        In fact, there are quite a few. Anything that fetches a sub-resource
        will be sanitized out by default, only to be opted in with an
        <code>allow=</code> attribute.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>allow="iframe"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          This allows the rendering of <code>&lt;iframe></code> elements in the
          response body.
        </dd>

        <dt><code>allow="i-html"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          This allows the rendering of <code>&lt;i-html></code> elements in the
          response body.
        </dd>

        <dt><code>allow="script"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          This allows the rendering of <code>&lt;script></code> elements in the
          response body.
        </dd>

        <dt><code>allow="style"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          This allows the rendering of <code>&lt;style></code> and
          <code>&lt;link rel=stylesheet</code> elements in the response body.
        </dd>

        <dt><code>allow="media"</code></dt>
        <dd>
          This allows the rendering of <code>&lt;img></code>,
          <code>&lt;picture></code>, <code>&lt;video></code>,
          <code>&lt;audio></code>, and <code>&lt;object></code>
          elements in the response body.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <pre>
        <code>

      <h4 id="turning-off-protections">Tuning off protections</h4>

      <p>
        Of course, if you like to live dangerously, you can turn all of this off
        by setting <code>allow="*"</code>. This is a very bad idea but can be
        useful during development.
      </p>

      <h3 id="dsd">Declarative Shadow DOM</h3>

      <p>
        Support for parsing fragments of HTML which include declarative shadow DOM (DSD) templates via <code>Document.parseHTMLUnsafe</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/parseHTMLUnsafe_static">recently entered Baseline 2024 status</a>, so <code>&lt;i-html></code> will use that method of parsing if supported. Older browsers would need a polyfill to handle those cases, otherwise, <code>&lt;i-html></code> will fall back on <code>new DOMParser().parseFromString</code> which does not support DSD.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> the "unsafe" nomenclature of this API simply means the browser won't perform any sanitization. (Coming soon to the web platform, there will be a `parseHTML` counterpart which does.) But as explained above, <code>&lt;i-html></code> will perform its <em>own</em> sanitizing process unless you choose to opt into the various `allow` directives.
      </p>

      <div class="demo">
        <i-html id="dsd-example" loading="lazy" src="example-responses/dsd.html">
          ... loading dsd ...
        </i-html>
      </div>

      <h3 id="styling">Styling</h3>

      <p>
        By default this element is <code>display: contents</code> so it won't
        effect layout, and it has <code>role=presentation</code> so the
        container itself has no impact on the accessibility tree. All of the
        content loaded in, however, will effect layout and the accessibility
        tree. There are 4 pseudo classes you can use to style it during various
        stages of its lifecycle, it will always be in one of these states, and
        never more than one. The states are <code>loading</code>,
        <code>loaded</code>, <code>errored</code>, and <code>waiting</code>.
        They can be styled like so:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <style style="display:block">
.foo:state(waiting) { background: grey; }
.foo:state(loading) { background: yellow; }
.foo:state(loaded) { background: green; }
.foo:state(error) { background: red; }
          </style>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <details>
        <summary>(For older browsers that don't support
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomStateSet"
          >CSS CustomStateSet</a
        > you'll need some additional CSS.)</summary>

        <p>
          The element will fall back to using attributes like
          <code>[state-waiting]</code> in older browsers, such as Safari 17.3
          and below, Firefox 125 and below, and Chrome 89 and below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chrome versions 90-124 used a different syntax for <code>:state()</code>,
          which used double dashes instead, like <code>:--waiting</code>. There's
          a small bit of support code to handle those versions and so it will fall
          back to using syntax like <code>:--waiting</code> if it needs to. If you need to
          support all of these you'll need something more like:
        </p>

        <pre><code><style style="display:block">
.foo:where(:state(waiting), :--waiting, [state-waiting]) { background: grey; }
.foo:where(:state(loading), :--loading, [state-loading]) { background: yellow; }
.foo:where(:state(loaded), :--loaded, [state-loaded]) { background: green; }
.foo:where(:state(error), :--error, [state-error]) { background: red; }
            </style>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </details>

      <p>
        Here are some details for what each of these states <em>mean</em>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>waiting</code> is the state used when the element is in the
            DOM, but either does not have a <code>src=</code> or has
            <code>loading=lazy</code> or <code>loading=none</code> and hasn't
            yet begun to load. Once an element has left the <code>waiting</code>
            state it'll never go back to it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>loading</code> is the state used when the element is in making
            a request, but the request hasn't yet completed. An individual
            element can enter and exit this state multiple times per session.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>streaming</code> is the state used when the request was an
            <code>text/event-stream</code> type, and the connection has been
            opened. In this state events can stream in, and the
            <code>loaded</code> state is removed. When the connection closes it
            will transition to a <code>loaded</code> or <code>error</code>
            state.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>loaded</code> is the state used when the element has
            successfully completed and closed the request and has inserted the
            content into the page, and has no more work to do for now. If the
            <code>src=</code> changes, it might move back to the
            <code>loading</code> state.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>error</code> is the state used when the element has completed
            a request, but the request failed somehow. Unless in streaming mode,
            the element won't have inserted any content into the page. If the
            <code>src=</code> or <code>accept=</code> attributes change, it
            might move back to the <code>loading</code> state.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="events">Events</h3>

      <p>
        There are a wealth of events that are fired for each stage of the
        element's lifecycle. Just like <code>&lt;img></code> and
        <code>&lt;iframe></code> elements, <code>&lt;i-html></code> elements
        dispatch <code>loadstart</code>, <code>load</code>,
        <code>loadend</code>, and <code>error</code> events to announce which
        stage of the loading process they're in. They also dispatch
        <code>beforeinsert</code>, and <code>inserted</code> events.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>loadstart</code> is dispatched right before a request is
            started. This event also has a <code>.request</code> property that
            is the <code>Request</code> object that will be given to
            <code>fetch()</code>. You can re-assign <code>.request</code> or
            mutate some of its properties, and whatever changes you make to it
            will propagate to the <code>fetch()</code> call, so the
            <code>loadstart</code> event is really useful if you want to
            customise requests beyond the default capabilities, for example
            adding new headers. You can call <code>.preventDefault()</code> on
            this event to stop loading happening altogether, and no subsequent
            events will fire unless the request lifecycle is restarted (for
            example by changing <code>src=</code>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>load</code> is dispatched as soon as the request has completed
            successfully. When streaming, this will be dispatched upon a
            successful (non error) close of the <code>EventSource</code>. This
            event does not come with any additional properties. This event isn't
            fired if the network request had an error.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>error</code> is dispatched if the network request failed for
            some reason, or if it was unable to be created for example due to
            bad Request data. This can happen when streaming if the connection
            errors, even after events have been sent. This event does not come
            with any additional properties.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>loadend</code> is dispatched at the end of a request,
            regardless of the end state of the request. In other words this will
            always come directly after a <code>load</code> or <code>error</code>
            event. This event does not come with any additional properties.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>beforeinsert</code> is dispatched right <em>before</em>the
            contents are about to be inserted into the page. In streaming mode
            this event could be fired many times. This comes with a
            <code>.content</code> property which is an array of all the child
            <code>Node</code>s about to be inserted into the element. If you
            re-assign or otherwise mutate this array, then that is what will be
            inserted. This is useful for doing extra sanitization or simply
            removing elements with additional scripting. If you want to do
            something even more radical, you can call
            <code>.preventDefault()</code> and it will <em>not</em>
            insert the contents, leaving it up to you what to do next. Other
            events will continue to fire, and if in streaming mode, you may get
            new data coming in.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>inserted</code> is dispatched right <em>after</em> the
            contents have been inserted into the page, provided that
            <code>beforeinsert</code> was not cancelled. In streaming mode this
            event could be fired many times. This comes with a
            <code>.content</code> property which is an array of all the child
            <code>Node</code>s that were inserted - which may be different to
            the elements <code>.childNodes</code>. This event is not
            preventable, as the action has already happened.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="faq">Questions you might have</h2>

      <h3 id="alternatives">What about using &lt;alternative>?</h3>

      <p>
        There are many elements like this, but none that are <em>quite</em> like
        this. I think this is a culmination of the best features of the other
        elements.
      </p>

      <h3 id="more-alternatives">What about using htmx / htmz?</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and
        <a href="https://leanrada.com/htmz">htmz</a> came as small inspiration
        for this library. htmx is a great project which demonstrates the power
        of leveraging HTML, and htmz is a great lightweight alternative that
        leans into the web platform even futher, but it also lacks some real
        niceties that you'd want from a component like this. This is why
        <code>&lt;i-html></code> exists - to take the concepts of htmz and
        expand them into a fully-fledged element, adding the missing features.
        If you want a fully featured and more popular library, try htmx.
        If you're after a really tiny codebase and leveraging as much of the
        web platform as possible, htmz looks to be a great choice. If you're
        after something a little bit in-between, I think <code>&lt;i-html></code>

      <h3 id="include-fragment">Why did you not extend include-fragment?</h3>

      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://github.com/github/include-fragment-element"
          >include-fragment-element</a
        >
        is very similar to this, and I'm the current maintainer of both, so it
        is within my power (and hubris) to make changes to that element to make
        it more like this element. However, I think they are spiritually
        different elements. This element definitely builds upon the success of
        <code>&lt;include-fragment></code>, but it also changes some design
        decisions that aren't worth changing in
        <code>&lt;include-fragment></code>, given its large user base and the
        amount of churn it would take to make those changes. In that regard you
        might consider this element a "rewrite" or a "major version bump" of
        <code>&lt;include-fragment</code>, but I think both have a valid use
        case and certainly both can co-exist, maybe even on the same website.

      <h3 id="include-fragment-differences">
        What are the differences between this and include-fragment then?
      </h3>

      <p>
        Aside from the obvious difference being the name,
        <code>&lt;inlude-fragment></code> has a smaller featureset, for example
        it doesn't support streaming mode, it doesn't support custom CSS states,
        it doesn't support preventing <code>loadstart</code> events. Those
        things could be added, but then it also has some big differences that
        are design decisions, and would be breaking changes.
        <code>&lt;include-fragment></code> replaces <em>itself</em> on the page,
        so a fully loaded fragment no longer exists on the page and the loaded
        HTML stands in its place. This is different to
        <code>&lt;i-html></code> which remains in the DOM, and can re-fetch
        contents again and again. This design change gives the two elements very
        different use cases, for example <code>&lt;i-html></code> respects link
        and form <code>target=</code> attributes which would seem pointless to
        do in <code>&lt;include-fragment></code> with this design choice in
        mind.
